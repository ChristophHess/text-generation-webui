# Fast Speak
A local only fast and high quality TTS for text generation based on espeak-ng due to it's many languages and often high quality
## Open Issues
- requires espeak https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases
- playing of audio currently only local (not really an issue imho because you can use an online service such as Amazon Polly or Elevenlabs if you're connecting to a public server anyway)
